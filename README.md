# JÂ²Adventures: A Full-Stack Travel Blog ðŸ¦«

This project is a modern, responsive homepage for a travel blog called "JÂ²Adventures," built on the **bhv** full-stack TypeScript monorepo starter. The frontend is a feature-rich React application, and the backend is a lightweight Hono server, all tied together with shared TypeScript types for end-to-end type safety.

---

## **Key Features**

- **Full-Stack TypeScript**: Ensures type safety between the client and server.
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized as a workspace-based monorepo for clean, manageable code.
- **Modern Tech Stack**:
  - **Bun**: JavaScript runtime
  - **Hono**: Backend framework
  - **Vite**: Frontend bundling
  - **React**: Frontend UI
  - **Tailwind CSS**: Styling
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: A dynamic masonry-style grid that adapts to all screen sizes.
- **Multiple Card Styles**: Includes split-view and hover-reveal cards for visual interest.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Automatically loads new articles as the user scrolls.
- **Dynamic Theming**: Allows users to switch between multiple color schemes.

---

## **Project Structure**

The project is organized into a monorepo with three main packages: `client`, `server`, and `shared`.

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ client/          # JÂ²Adventures React frontend
â”œâ”€â”€ server/          # Hono backend
â””â”€â”€ shared/          # Shared TypeScript types
```

### **Frontend: JÂ²Adventures Homepage**

The client is a React and TypeScript application styled with Tailwind CSS. It features a responsive design with multiple card styles, infinite scrolling, and dynamic theming. The article content is easily customizable through a mock data array.

### **Backend: Hono Server**

The server uses Hono, a simple and fast backend framework. It's set up to serve API routes, and you can easily add a database like Supabase, Drizzle, or Prisma.

```typescript
// Example of a simple API route in server/src/index.ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import type { ApiResponse } from "shared/dist";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/hello", async (c) => {
  const data: ApiResponse = {
    message: "Hello from the JÂ²Adventures API!",
    success: true,
  };
  return c.json(data, { status: 200 });
});

export default app;
```

### **Shared Types**

The `shared` package allows you to define types that can be used in both the client and server, ensuring that the data flowing between them is always consistent.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Quick Start**

You can create a new project using the `create-bhvr` CLI:

```bash
bun create bhvr
```

### **Installation**

Install dependencies for all workspaces:

```bash
bun install
```

### **Development**

Run the entire stack concurrently:

```bash
bun run dev
```

### **Deployment**

The client and server can be deployed independently to various platforms.

- **Client (React App)**: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages
- **Server (Hono)**: Cloudflare Workers, or any environment that supports Bun.
